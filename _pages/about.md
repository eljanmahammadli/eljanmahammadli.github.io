# About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Polygraf AI and a recent graduate from George Washington University's M.S. in Computer Science program. My research interests span across various areas of artificial intelligence, including large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and multimodal systems. I'm particularly interested in advancing the capabilities and efficiency of these systems through novel architectural approaches and deployment strategies.

At George Washington University, under the supervision of Dr. Samir Rustamov, I worked on developing small language models, where I contributed to building a pre-trained language model for the Azerbaijani language. 

I'm actively seeking PhD opportunities to pursue advanced research in AI/ML, with a focus on pushing the boundaries of language and multimodal systems.
