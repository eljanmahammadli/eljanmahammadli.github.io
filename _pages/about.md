# About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Polygraf AI](https://polygraf.ai) and a recent graduate from [George Washington University's](https://www.gwu.edu) M.S. in Computer Science program. My research interests span across various areas of artificial intelligence, including large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and multimodal systems. I'm particularly interested in advancing the capabilities and efficiency of these systems through novel architectural approaches and deployment strategies.

At George Washington University, under the supervision of [Dr. Samir Rustamov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QnvLW9cAAAAJ&hl=en), I worked on developing small language models, where I contributed to building a [pre-trained language model](https://huggingface.co/eljanmahammadli/AzLlama-152M) for the Azerbaijani language. 

## ðŸŽ“ PhD Applications - Fall 2025
I'm seeking PhD positions starting Fall 2025, with research interests focused on:
- Large Language Models: Architectures, efficiency, and scaling dynamics
- Vision-Language Models: Multimodal understanding and reasoning
- Cross-modal learning and representation
